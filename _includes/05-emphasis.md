I am a second year Computer Science Engineering student from Heritage Institute of Technology, Kolkata.
I am well versed in **Python** and have started building a number of basic projects. I am deeply interested in **Data Science and Machine Learning, especially its application in the field of Sports Analysis and Analytics** and am currently working on a dataset of IPL matches from seasons 2008-2017, hoping to extract some meaningful insights.
My passion is **cricket.** I have been playing cricket since I was eight, and *currently I am a sub divisional cricketer in Bengal.* Apart from cricket, I like to watch movies and tv shows as well, *especially science fiction ones*, and I try to keep myself updated with the local, national and even international political and social happenings.
